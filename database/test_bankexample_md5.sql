-- Sample Bank Database
-- MD5 Checksum Validation Queries
--
-- Purpose:
--   This script validates the integrity of bankexample database tables by
--   calculating and comparing MD5 checksums of their concatenated column values.
--
-- Note:
--   - Data is fictional; any resemblance to real persons or entities is purely coincidental.
--   - Replace the placeholder expected CRC values with actual values after first run.
