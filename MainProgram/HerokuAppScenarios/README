## Test Case Design Strategy

The test cases are functionally prioritized and designed using:

- **Equivalence Partitioning (EP):** Group inputs that should be treated the same to avoid exhaustive testing.
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):** Ensure test coverage at the edges of partitions to catch off-by-one or range errors.
- **Priority Ranking:** Each test case is tagged with a priority based on functional impact.

Displays a modal window when the user moves their mouse out of the viewport (exit intent).
